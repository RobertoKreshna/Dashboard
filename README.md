# V-PRO Property Dashboard

A web app for the V-PRO property agency to manage **listings**, **sales agents** and **closed deals**.
Staff work in a login-protected admin area; one page, the **public Listing Dashboard** (`/listings-public`), is open to everyone.

## What it does

**Public (no login)**
- Map-and-list property browser: a drill-down map (Indonesia → province → city → district → village) beside the matching listings. Hovering a listing highlights it on the map and the other way round; once a district is chosen, each listing is a marker.
- Filters: search, sell/rent, property type, status (default *Available*), price range slider, bedrooms, bathrooms, city, district, sales code, sort.
- Listing detail page with photo gallery, facilities, agent name and an "Open in Google Maps" link.
- Never exposes internal notes, agent phone/email, or anything about deals.

**Staff (login required)**
- **Dashboard** — active listings, deals and deal value this month, a listings map, a **Deals over time** line chart (by day for a month, by month for a year or all time; split by total, payment type incl. each bank, or salesperson) and **Top sales codes** for the chosen period.
- **Listings** — create/edit/delete, photo upload with cover + drag-to-reorder, facilities (add your own), cascading Province → City → District → Village dropdowns, map coordinates, status, internal notes. "Mark as Done Deal" button.
- **Done Deals** — create from a listing (pre-filled, listing status switches to Sold/Rented, back to Available if the deal is deleted) or manually; payment type (Cash / Bank, with ~118 Indonesian banks); commission amount or percentage; date-range, payment, sales and city filters; totals; **Excel/CSV export**.
- **Sales** (sales codes) — agents CRUD, active/inactive, deletion blocked while listings or deals still use the code.

Rupiah formatting (`Rp 1.500.000.000`) and `dd/mm/yyyy` dates throughout.

## Tech stack

Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript) · Drizzle ORM · Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage) · Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui (Base UI) · Plotly (maps and charts) · zod · SheetJS (`xlsx`) · dnd-kit.
Works with **bun** or **npm** (examples use bun; swap `bun run` ↔ `npm run`).

## Quick start

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. `cp .env.example .env.local` and fill it in (see [Environment variables](#environment-variables)).
3. `bun install`
4. `bun run db:migrate` — creates the tables, public views, Row Level Security policies and the `listing-photos` storage bucket.
5. `bun run db:seed` — sample sales codes, ~112 listings and deals. With `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` set it also creates a staff login (`SEED_STAFF_EMAIL` / `SEED_STAFF_PASSWORD`, defaulting to `staff@vpro.example` / `ChangeMe123!`). **Change that password.**
   Add more staff with `bun run staff:add someone@vpro.id 'a-long-password'`. A user created only in the Supabase dashboard is **not** staff until you run `staff:add` for them (see [Security](#security)).
6. `bun run dev` → http://localhost:3000 (staff) · http://localhost:3000/listings-public (public).

## Environment variables

| Variable | Used for |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Publishable/anon key (browser + server auth) |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | **Server/scripts only** — creating the seed staff user. Never expose it to the browser |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Direct Postgres connection used by Drizzle (pooler or direct URL) |
| `SEED_STAFF_EMAIL`, `SEED_STAFF_PASSWORD` | Optional: login created by `db:seed` |

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Import the project; Vercel detects Next.js (no `vercel.json` needed). Use Node 22 (Project Settings → General).
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL`. Leave `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` out — only the local staff/seed scripts use it.
3. Use the Supabase **transaction pooler** for `DATABASE_URL` (port `6543`; the direct `db.<ref>.supabase.co` host is IPv6-only and unreachable from Vercel). The client already disables prepared statements and uses one connection per instance on Vercel.
4. Run `db:migrate` from your machine (direct or session-pooler URL, port `5432`), not from the pooler on 6543.
5. In Supabase set the Site URL to the Vercel domain, and add a Vercel Firewall rate-limit rule for `/login` (the built-in limits are per instance).

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bun run dev` / `build` / `start` | Next.js dev server / production build / serve the build |
| `bun run lint` | ESLint |
| `bun run db:generate` | Generate a Drizzle migration after editing `src/db/schema.ts` |
| `bun run db:migrate` | Apply all migrations in `drizzle/` |
| `bun run db:seed` | Seed a fresh database (add `-- --reset` to wipe and reseed — destructive) |
| `bun run db:seed:more [count] [--city="Kota Makassar"]` | **Append** generated listings + deals; never deletes anything |
| `bun run db:studio` | Drizzle Studio |
| `bun run staff:add <email> [password]` | Create a staff login, or promote an existing user (sets `app_metadata.role = "staff"`) |
| `bun run staff:remove <email>` | Remove staff access from a user |
| `bun run geo:build` | Build map boundary tiles (see below) |

## Data model

Tables: `sales_codes`, `facilities`, `listings`, `listing_photos`, `deals` (IDs like `LST-0001` / `DL-0001` come from Postgres sequences). Migrations live in `drizzle/`.
Photos live in the public-read `listing-photos` bucket (`<listing-id>/<uuid>.<ext>`); uploads go straight from the browser to Storage (images only, 10 MB max, enforced by the bucket).

## Security

**Who is "staff"?** A Supabase user with `app_metadata.role = "staff"`. That field can only be written with the service-role key, so it can't be self-assigned. The app (`proxy.ts`, `requireUser()`, the login action) *and* the database policies all require it. This matters because **Supabase allows open sign-ups by default**: without the role check, anyone could register and get full access.

| Layer | Protection |
|---|---|
| Database | RLS on every table; the only policy requires the staff role (`0004_staff_only_policies.sql`). `anon` has no table access. `TRUNCATE`/`TRIGGER`/`REFERENCES` revoked from API roles. |
| Public data | Public pages read only the `public_listings` / `public_listing_photos` views — no internal notes, agent phone/email or deals. |
| Storage | Anyone can read photos; only staff can write. |
| App | Every server action and the export route call `requireUser()`; server actions get Next's built-in origin (CSRF) check. Inputs are validated with zod; URL filters are whitelisted/clamped; all SQL is parameterised. |
| Login | Per-IP+email and per-IP rate limits, generic error messages, open-redirect-safe `?next=`, non-staff accounts are rejected and signed out. |
| Abuse | In-memory rate limits on login, public pages (240/min/IP) and exports (15/min/user). These are per server instance — also enable platform protection (Vercel Firewall, Cloudflare). |
| Exports | Cells starting with `= + - @` are neutralised (spreadsheet formula injection). |
| Headers | CSP (no third-party origins: even the Plotly base map is self-hosted in `public/geo/plotly`), `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, HSTS in production; `X-Powered-By` removed. |
| Dependencies | `npm audit --omit=dev` is clean. `xlsx` is installed from SheetJS's own patched release (the npm copy is stuck on a vulnerable version); the `shadcn` CLI is a dev dependency. |

**Things to know**
- The app connects to Postgres directly (`DATABASE_URL`, the `postgres` role), which **bypasses RLS**. The public pages are safe because the code only queries the two public views — keep it that way. (Hardening idea: a dedicated low-privilege role for the public read path.)
- On Supabase the views are created with `security_invoker`, so `anon` cannot read them through the REST API either. That is fine: the app never uses the REST API for data, and the service-role key is only used by the seed/staff scripts. It must **never** be exposed to the browser or given a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` name.
- Supabase's `listing-photos` bucket is public by design (listing photos are public).

**Supabase dashboard checklist (not settable from code)**
1. Authentication → Sign In / Providers → turn **off** "Allow new users to sign up". (The staff-role check already blocks sign-ups from the app and database, but there is no reason to leave it open.)
2. Authentication → Policies/Sign-in: raise the minimum password length (12+), and enable leaked-password protection if your plan has it. Consider MFA for staff.
3. Rotate any key or password that has been pasted into chat/tickets (database password, service-role key). The publishable (anon) key is public by design.
4. Set the site URL and redirect URLs to your real domain once deployed.
5. Keep `.env.local` out of git (it is ignored) and use your host's secret store in production.

## Map & location data

The map and the location dropdowns use boundary tiles in `public/geo` (generated, ~20 MB):

| Level | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Provinces, cities/regencies, districts, villages (names) | [cahyadsn/wilayah_boundaries](https://github.com/cahyadsn/wilayah_boundaries) — MIT, 2025 codes | Whole country; village *names* for all 514 cities, village *shapes* only where built |
| Districts + villages for cities that have listings | **BIG** (Badan Informasi Geospasial) 1:10,000 via its public ArcGIS service | ~60× more detail; used when available, base data otherwise |

```bash
bun run geo:build                          # everything above (cities with listings get village shapes + BIG detail)
bun run geo:build --city="Kota Manado"     # also build village shapes for a specific city
bun run geo:build --villages=all           # village shapes for every city (very large)
bun run geo:build --no-big                 # skip the BIG upgrade (don't mix with a later partial run: it overwrites the BIG tiles)
bun run geo:build --force                  # rebuild existing files
```

**Re-run `geo:build` after adding listings in a new city**, otherwise that city's village level says its boundaries aren't installed (the form's village dropdown still works from the names list).
Listing region names must match the official names (e.g. *Kota Bandung* ≠ the Bandung regency *Bandung*); anything that doesn't match is listed under the map instead of silently dropped.
Boundary data is from 2020–2025 and newer regions may be missing. BIG requires attribution (shown in the public footer) and publishes no explicit licence text — confirm its terms before relying on it commercially. The MIT-licensed base data is the safe fallback (`--no-big`).

## Sample data

```bash
bun run db:seed                                   # 12 hand-written + 100 generated listings, deals (cash/bank mix)
bun run db:seed:more 40 --city="Kota Makassar"    # add 40 more in one city (names must match scripts/seed-bulk.ts)
```
Generated listings get coordinates inside their own village polygon (run `geo:build` first). Sample listings have no photos.

## Notes

- Brand: text mark **V-PRO**; palette — blue `#4AA8DE`, light blue `#A9D6F0`, yellow `#E8C12E` (accent only), text `#1F2937`. White text on the lighter blue is below the usual contrast guideline, so primary buttons use semi-bold text.
- `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` come from the Next.js template and point at the bundled Next.js docs in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`.
- Node 20 works but Supabase's client warns that Node 22+ will be required in future.
